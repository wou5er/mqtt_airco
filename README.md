Requirements:
ESP8266 microcontroller
Relay module
Membrane water pump
Water level sensor



This project enables control of a portable air conditioner using analog buttons.
Communication is handled via MQTT protocol.

An integrated control system continuously monitors the condensate water level and activates the pump to remove excess water when the level exceeds a set threshold.
